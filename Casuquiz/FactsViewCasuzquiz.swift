    FactCasuzquiz(title: "The Eternal Storm", content: "The Catatumbo Lightning is a unique atmospheric phenomenon occurring over the Catatumbo River in Venezuela. Known as the 'Eternal Storm,' it produces lightning strikes almost 300 days a year. This natural light show occurs due to the region's unique geography: warm, humid air from Lake Maracaibo rises and collides with cold winds from the Andes, creating massive electrical discharges. The phenomenon generates more ozone than any other lightning storm on Earth, contributing to the planet's ozone layer."),
    
    FactCasuzquiz(title: "The Boiling River", content: "In the heart of the Amazon rainforest, there is a mysterious river known as the Shanay-Timpishka, or 'The Boiling River.' Its waters reach temperatures of up to 93°C (200°F), hot enough to scald and even kill animals that fall in. Scientists believe the heat originates from geothermal energy, where water from underground reservoirs is superheated and then surfaces through faults in the Earth's crust. Local legends suggest the river has sacred properties, blending indigenous spirituality with unique natural phenomena."),
    
    FactCasuzquiz(title: "The Underwater Waterfall", content: "Off the coast of Mauritius, there is an optical illusion that looks like an underwater waterfall.
